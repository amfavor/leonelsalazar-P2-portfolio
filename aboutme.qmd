Hello my name is Leo. 

I am not going to post a picture of myself.

I graduated from UTSA with a bachelors in Business Analytics and Operations and Supply Chain Management.

I was in the USAF.

I currently work for the USAF as an electronics technician.

Avid sports fan. My teams are the Dallas Cowboys, San Antonio Spurs, Chicago Blackhawks, Houston Astros. 

I like to visit https://www.kaggle.com/ from time to time. See what kinds of different ways people are presenting different datasets.

If you have any questions just ask. As you can tell, I'm an open book.
